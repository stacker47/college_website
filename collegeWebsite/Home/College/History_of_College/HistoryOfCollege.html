        <h2>The Foundation of D.A-V. College</h2>
        <p>
            July 11, 1919 was a landmark day in the annals of Kanpur. The foundation of DAV College was laid amidst the chanting of Vedic incantations by the most revered Mahatma Hansraj Ji, a great educator, sage, and leader of the Arya Samaj Movement. He had been the founder of several educational Institutions in Punjab and Delhi. His presence in the city of the Ganges blessed all of us and opened a new horizon of education in the city. His thrust was on sacrifice, self-help and economy. With his visionary prowess he led us along the path to inextinguishable glory.

        <h2>Lala Diwan Chand</h2>
        <p>
            The founder principal of the college, Lala Diwan Chand, a renowned scholar. Educationist, social reformer and a great freedom fighter, always led the college from the front. His inspiration was a boost for the people associated with this noble cause of education. Since the inception of the college, he strove untiringly to provide quality education for young people. His primary concern was to send both successful students and responsible citizens back to society. As a result of his uncompromising endeavour, the college has produced successful administrators, great academicians, famous artists, politicians and sports people who have brought laurels to the alma mater.

        <h2>Contribution to the Freedom Struggle</h2>
        <p>
            DAV College has contributed immensely to the freedom struggle. It has had a tradition of imbibing love for the nation among its students. During the freedom struggle, the college hostel was the nerve centre of patriotic activities. Our students played a pivotal role in creating national awakening in society by participating in the movement actively. Late Shiv Verma, Shri Surendra Pandey, Jaidev Kapoor and Mahadev Singh were students of the college and were tried for the famous Kakori Case. The great martyr Pt. Saligram Shukla, whose statue graces the campus, set an example for others to follow.

        <h2>Mahatma Gandhi's Visit</h2>
        <p>
            The patriotic fervour got a boost in 1928 by the memorable visit of Mahatma Gandhi. The students participated and associated in the movement led by Gandhi Ji with high spirits. It was amazing to see the sea of students that gathered to listen to Gandhi Ji, who addressed them at the wee hours of the morning. That was a sign of the patriotic fervour which ran in the veins of the DAVians. The Mahatma's speech infused an inextinguishable patriotic fervour among the youth and taught them that patriots don't talk about taking life but of giving life for their country and that patriotism is like a needle that joins and unites and not a scissor that cuts and divides.

        <h2>Attaining Special Place in North India</h2>
        <p>The contributions of Rai Bahadur Anand Swaroop, Dr. Brijendra Swaroop, Shri Jawahar Lal Rohtagi, Shri Chirasen, Shri Devendra Swaroop and Dr. Virendra Swaroop cannot be a thing of the past. Their dynamic leadership enabled the college to attain a special place in the whole of North India. These missionaries of enlightenment firmly believed in the dictum that true education could alone form the sound basis of national awakening. The founders of the college were inspired by the teachings of Arya Samaj, but at the same time, they were aware of their responsibility towards the building of the nation.

        <h2>The Post Independence Period</h2>
        <p>During the post-independence period, there was a gradual increase in the number of Indian children who attended college. There was a need to cater to their academic aspirations. This promoted greater opportunities within the wider society and led Dr. Virendra Swarup to play a vital role in promoting the cause of education in the province. As the torch bearer of mission education in Uttar Pradesh, Dr. Virendra Swarup laid great importance on education and strove relentlessly to improve the standard of education by establishing educational institutions throughout Uttar Pradesh.

                    The Information Communication Technology has brought the entire globe on one platform. Exchanging of Information and expertise has become absolutely essential for the actualization of the goals in higher education. The DAV College website is an honest attempt at providing essential information with a view to bridging the gulfs in higher education. The Vision of the College is Leadership through Excellence in Education. This vision can only be realised if there is a well articulate strategic plan that guides the college as to where it is coming from, where it is now, where it is going, why it is going and how it will arrive there. The college will soon be inviting its stakeholders to make contributions to the process of taking the college to the new heights.
                    It is my pleasure to report that the college has taken all necessary steps to achieve its desired goal of excellence in higher education. We believe this development will go a long way towards enhancing the endeavours of the college to retain its high quality and calibre, and also to deliver on its mandate. It is also heartening to hear that the college is constantly striving to prove itself an asset for higher education by ensuring all round development of the students.
                    We welcome suggestions for the improvement of the site. We also invite all DAVians to join the Alumni Association and further the glorious DAV tradition
                    The college website, I am sure, shall prove to be useful to all quarters of the academia by catering to the academic needs of prospective students and by functioning as a bridge between the stakeholders and the society.

                <p>
                    I welcome all to the revamped version of the college website. I also take the moment as an opportunity to share my views with all stakeholders.
                    Ninety-seven years have passed smoothly since the inception of the college. In all these years, the academic orchard of the college has grown into a full-fledged garden of excellence. By adopting a non-discriminatory approach in imparting quality education to all irrespective of their class, creed, and religion, the college has lived up to its vision and mission.
                    The college has had many trysts with history by being the breeding ground of nationalism and patriotism. Under the leadership of the great Chandra Shekhar Azad thousands of freedom fighters thronged every nook and corner of the college building to replenish and renew their patriotic fervour. This historical college has hosted the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi on his visit to Kanpur during the freedom struggle. Students aspiring to be a part of this college ought to realise that they are walking into the annals of history and that they have to further this glorious tradition.
                    The college has been established upon the ideals of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, who preached that the essence of enlightenment lies in holistic education. The college has remained true to these ideals by inculcating in students highest values and best practices. As a result, alumni of the college, including Bharat Ratna Atal Behari Vajpayee, have excelled in all walks of life.
                    I once again take this opportunity to thank all alumni, stakeholders, and everyone associated with the college for keeping our glorious tradition alive.
